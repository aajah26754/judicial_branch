            <h2>Brown v. Board of Education (1954) - Ending School Segregation</h2>
            <p>Brown v. Board of Education was a US Supreme Court case that challenged
                racial segregation in public schools.
            </p>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <b>The Precedent Set</b>
                <li>This cases overturned Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), this kept racial
                    segregation under the "seperate but equal" doctrine
                </li>
                <li>The Supreme Court ruled that racial segregation in public schools violated
                    the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment
                </li>
                <li>The court delcared that segregation is unconstitutional, this sets the stage

                    to slow changes
                </li>
                <li>Brown II ordered schools to desegregate with "all deliberate speed," but there
                    was weak enforcement
                </li>
                <li>The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and other court ruling helped strengthened the decision
                    and made integrating schools a national priority.

            <h2>Department of Education v. Louisiana (2024)</h2>
            <b>The Background</b>
            <p>
                In 2024, the US Department of Education changed the rules to help protect
                students. This protected them from discrimintion based on gender idenity and
                sexual orientation. Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, and Idaho, challenged
                this rule. they argued that it unlawfully redefined sex discrimintion and
                overstepped students' and employees' rights.
            </p>
            <b>Court Ruling</b>
            <p>
                In June 2024, the US District Court for the Western District of Lousisana temporarily
                blcoked the enforcement of the Department's rule in plaintiff states. The courts
                ruled in favor of the states. the judge beleived that the Department may have went
                beyond its legal power.
            </p>
            <b>The Impact</b>
            <p>
                The court's decision stopped the new rule from being used in Lousisana and other states. This
                kept the same rules about discrimintion in pace. This case shows the ongoing dispute
                about how to define discrimintion and whether the federal government or states
                should make school policies.
            </p>
